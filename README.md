# please-intellij

This project contains a plugin that integrates Please with JetBrains products such as intellij. This plugin 
is under active development but supports the BUILD Language.

There's also support for run configurations, however at the moment, this requires the Golang plugin to be
installed. This is to facilitate debugging go targets, however we are working on a way to make basic build/run
features available universally.
